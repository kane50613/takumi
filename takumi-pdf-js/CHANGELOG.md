### Draw header and footer bands in the page margins

Bands previously reserved their height inside the content window, so a footered document paginated earlier than Chrome's print output. They now lay out at full page width and draw in the margin areas with Chromium's 15pt edge inset. The content window always spans the full margin box.

### Write page geometry in PDF points

Pages were sized in CSS px written as pt, so an A4 document came out 33% oversized when printed. Page size, annotations, and outline destinations now convert at 0.75 pt/px. Layout still runs in px.

### Fill the page content box like a browser body

A fit-content root resolved child percentage widths inconsistently across layout passes. Long documents could overlap trailing content and drop pages entirely.

### Auto-height viewport

`viewport.height` is now optional. Omitting it sizes the single page to the laid-out content, like a thermal receipt.

### Render SVG image sources

SVG images passed via `images` came out as blank space; the backend only embedded bitmap sources. SVG sources now rasterize at twice their displayed size and embed like other images.

### Ship the `tw` prop type

Importing only `takumi-pdf` left JSX `tw` props failing to typecheck; the react module augmentation now ships with the package types.

### Publish takumi-pdf, the wasm PDF package

`render(jsx)` turns a node tree or JSX into a paged PDF with selectable text and embedded subset fonts, on Node, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. Options mirror Puppeteer's `page.pdf()`: `size` (`"a4"`, `"letter"`, `{ width, height }`), `landscape`, per-side margins, and repeating header/footer bands with Chromium-style `pageNumber`/`totalPages` class hooks and CSS counter styles, while `viewport` renders a fixed single page instead. Fonts, images, and stylesheets round out the options.
