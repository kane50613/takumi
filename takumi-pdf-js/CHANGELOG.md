## takumi-pdf@0.3.0

### Measure a tree without rendering

`measure` returns a tree's laid-out size in CSS px. With page options it lays out at the full-page width with counter hooks filled, exactly how `render` measures a header or footer band. The height tells you how much margin the band needs.

### File attachments

Attach files with `attachments`, the PDF/A-3 shape ZUGFeRD and Factur-X e-invoices use. `data` takes bytes or a UTF-8 string. `modificationDate` falls back to `metadata.creationDate`. Invalid `pdfa` combinations are TypeScript type errors. Without type checking they reject the render at runtime.

### Embed SVG image sources as vectors

SVG images previously rasterized at 2× their placed size, leaving small logos soft next to vector text. They now embed as real paths, gradients and clips, sharp at any zoom. Filters and bitmaps embedded inside an SVG still rasterize at 2×.

### PDF/A and tagged output

Output is now tagged by default, like Chromium's print-to-PDF. The structure tree comes from the HTML semantics: headings, paragraphs, figures with alt text, links, and header/footer artifacts. Decorative `<img alt="">` images are artifacts. `tagged: false` turns the tree off. `tagged: "ua1"` validates against PDF/UA-1.

Set `pdfa` to a level from `"2b"` to `"4"` to emit archival PDFs with an sRGB output intent and XMP metadata. The `a` levels require the structure tree and `metadata.creationDate`. A document that cannot conform rejects the render instead of writing a broken file.

### Shrink the WebAssembly binary by 5%

Size-optimize the PDF serialization and font subsetting crates. The shipped wasm drops about 220KB with render speed and output bytes unchanged.

## takumi-pdf@0.2.0

### Draw header and footer bands in the page margins

Bands previously reserved their height inside the content window, so a footered document paginated earlier than Chrome's print output. They now lay out at full page width and draw in the margin areas with Chromium's 15pt edge inset. The content window always spans the full margin box.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.5

### Write page geometry in PDF points

Pages were sized in CSS px written as pt, so an A4 document came out 33% oversized when printed. Page size, annotations, and outline destinations now convert at 0.75 pt/px. Layout still runs in px.

### Fill the page content box like a browser body

A fit-content root resolved child percentage widths inconsistently across layout passes. Long documents could overlap trailing content and drop pages entirely.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.1

### Auto-height viewport

`viewport.height` is now optional. Omitting it sizes the single page to the laid-out content, like a thermal receipt.

### Render SVG image sources

SVG images passed via `images` came out as blank space; the backend only embedded bitmap sources. SVG sources now rasterize at twice their displayed size and embed like other images.

### Ship the `tw` prop type

Importing only `takumi-pdf` left JSX `tw` props failing to typecheck; the react module augmentation now ships with the package types.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.0

### Publish takumi-pdf, the wasm PDF package

`render(jsx)` turns a node tree or JSX into a paged PDF with selectable text and embedded subset fonts, on Node, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. Options mirror Puppeteer's `page.pdf()`: `size` (`"a4"`, `"letter"`, `{ width, height }`), `landscape`, per-side margins, and repeating header/footer bands with Chromium-style `pageNumber`/`totalPages` class hooks and CSS counter styles, while `viewport` renders a fixed single page instead. Fonts, images, and stylesheets round out the options.
