## takumi-pdf@0.5.0

### Validate against PDF/UA-2

`tagged: "ua2"` writes PDF/UA-2, which pairs with PDF/A-4 and needs a document language.

### Draw inline images and containers

An `<img>` inside a paragraph now draws, and carries its `alt` into the structure tree.

### Follow a rounded axis with the `auto` one

`background-size` with one `auto` axis kept the size it was first given when `background-repeat: round` rescaled the other. The tile stopped matching the image's shape. It now follows, as it already did in the raster and SVG backends.

### Route shared codepoints to the subset that declares them

A Google Fonts subset encodes more than the `unicode-range` it was cut for, and the Cyrillic and Greek ones also carry the ASCII space and the Latin capitals. Selection took the first subset whose glyphs covered a character, in family-name order, so those codepoints left the Latin subset and every word split into separate runs. Subsets now rank by the range they declare, lowest first.

### Place replaced content from one place

`object-fit` and `object-position` place replaced content from one place. An `object-position` past 100% now clips to the content box.

### Ask a background layer once whether it paints

`BackgroundImage::paints` replaces the three spellings each backend had for the same question.

PDF used to treat a `url()` layer as unpaintable when built without the `images` feature, which skipped the whole background-image pass rather than that one layer.

### Skip the ink an underline runs through, in every backend

`text-decoration-skip-ink` breaks an underline where the glyph outlines cross it, in every backend. A gap inside a letter stays a gap.

### Report the measured tree's own width

`measure` handed back the width it laid the tree out against, so a box with `width: 100px` measured 793 on an A4 page. It now reports the size the tree itself took.

### Paint text decorations from one place

`paint_run_decorations` paints a run's underline, overline and line-through for every backend.

### Tag `<figure>` as a Figure

A `<figure>` becomes a `Figure` carrying its image's `alt`. The `<figcaption>` inside becomes a `Caption` child of it. Captions used to reach the document root, which no standard allows.

### Resolve inline boxes once, for every backend

`resolve_inline_box` places an inline box's replaced content or nested subtree, shared by the SVG and PDF backends.

### Shade a 3D border in every backend

`inset`, `outset`, `groove` and `ridge` borders now shade their sides in the SVG and PDF backends, as the raster backend already did.

### Correct the PDF 2.0 structure namespace

A tagged PDF/A-4 document now names its structure namespace `http://iso.org/pdf2/ssn`, the identifier ISO 32000-2 defines. The old one matched no known namespace, so PDF/UA-2 validators rejected every structure element in the file.

### Paint the outline above the content

An `outline` painted under the box's own text and images, so a negative `outline-offset` disappeared behind them. CSS 2.1 Appendix E paints the outline last, and every backend now does.

### Draw dashed, dotted and double borders in PDF

`dashed`, `dotted` and `double` borders and outlines now draw in PDF instead of falling back to solid.

## takumi-pdf@0.4.2

### Render the weight the text asked for

A variable font is embedded at the coordinates the run was shaped at, so `font-weight` and `font-stretch` reach the page instead of the font's default instance. A face with no bold or oblique of its own gets the same synthesized ones the raster renderer applies.

### Render HTML strings

`render()`, `measure()`, and the header and footer options accept HTML strings, the same input format as `takumi-js`. A `<style>` tag applies only to that render.

## takumi-pdf@0.4.1

### Attach files under PDF/A-4

`pdfa: "4f"` renders the PDF 2.0 archival level that takes attachments. The other `"4"` level still rejects them.

### Emit a structure tree PDF/UA accepts

Headings are renumbered by nesting depth, so a document that opens at `h2` or jumps from `h1` to `h4` no longer writes a tree the validator rejects. A list item outside a list now brings its own list. A heading whose text sits in child elements, such as `<h1>Plain <strong>bold</strong></h1>`, reaches the outline instead of being dropped, which used to fail a `tagged: "ua1"` render outright.

## takumi-pdf@0.4.0

### Write shorter paths

Box decorations wrote every corner point twice and spelled out the closing edge that `h` draws anyway. Rectangles now use the `re` operator, and segments that go nowhere are dropped. A two-page invoice loses 12% of its bytes and renders about 3% faster.

### Close the CSS paint gaps against the raster backend

`outline`, `text-shadow`, `-webkit-text-stroke`, `url()` background and mask layers, `background-origin`, `background-clip` (including `text` and `border-area`) and `background-blend-mode` now paint.

- outlines ride the border machinery: offset outward, following the radius, no layout impact
- text shadows draw as shifted glyph passes under the text; PDF has no blur operator, so a blurred one draws sharp
- `background-clip: text` fills the glyphs with the background color and gradient layers, so gradient text stays selectable vector text
- url() layers rasterize like a filtered image and honor intrinsic sizing, so `background-size: auto`, `cover` and `contain` resolve like the raster backend

### Draw `box-shadow`

Outer and inset shadows now paint. The offset, spread and rounded corners are exact: the shadow is the border box spread and moved, with the box itself cut out by an even-odd fill so nothing paints under an opaque element.

PDF has no blur operator, so a blurred shadow is approximated by eight bands whose opacity follows the Gaussian edge coverage CSS specifies, with a standard deviation of half the blur radius. The shifted, unblurred shape stays fully opaque underneath, and a shadow with no blur draws as one exact fill.

Inset shadows draw inside the padding box, so a border neither carries shadow paint nor widens the shadow.

### Mark backgrounds and borders as artifacts

Backgrounds and borders were painted outside any tagged content sequence. PDF/UA-1 validators reported untagged content on every page that drew one. They are now artifacts, like header and footer bands.

### Write colours to four decimals

An eight-bit colour component divided by 255 printed as `0.047058824`, once per painted element. Four decimals resolve finer than the value it came from, and readers see the same colour.

### Custom XMP metadata

`metadata.xmp` takes namespaces to write into the XMP packet, for metadata the renderer knows nothing about. One is the `fx:` schema that turns a PDF/A-3 with an attached invoice into a Factur-X file.

- each schema carries a prefix, a namespace URI, and its properties
- every property is written as a value and described in the `pdfaExtension:schemas` entry PDF/A requires, so the two cannot drift apart
- a prefix, property name or namespace the XMP writer cannot serialize rejects the render instead of writing a broken packet

### Fade elements with `mask-image`

Gradient mask layers now apply, as a PDF soft mask holding the mask's own vector content. The masked element and its descendants stay vector: nothing is rasterized to fade an element out.

`mask-size`, `mask-position` and `mask-repeat` place the layers, the same way they place a background. `url()` mask sources are still ignored, and the mask is an alpha mask, which is what `mask-mode: match-source` resolves to for an image source.

### Clip elements with `clip-path`

`inset()`, `ellipse()`, `polygon()` and `path()` now clip an element and its decorations, as a real PDF clipping path rather than a rasterized mask.

`clip_shape_commands` in takumi-core resolves a basic shape to path commands, which is where the raster backend's copy of that geometry now lives too.

### Write less per embedded font

`/DW` now states the width most glyphs share, so `/W` only lists the ones that differ, which empties it almost entirely for monospaced and CJK faces. The `CIDSet` stream is gone: only PDF/A-1b asks for one, and that level is not offered. `/FontBBox` comes from the subset's own box instead of a pass over every glyph outline.

### Apply the color `filter` primitives

`grayscale`, `sepia`, `saturate`, `hue-rotate`, `invert`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `opacity` now apply. They are linear transforms of the source color, so they fold into the colors written to the page, including gradient stops, text and decoded image pixels, instead of rasterizing the element.

- filters apply in order, clamping between them as CSS requires, and an ancestor's filter runs after the element's own, like the group it wraps
- SVG images rasterize while a filter is active, since the transform applies to pixels
- shadows follow the filter too, like every other color the element paints
- `blur()` and `drop-shadow()` need a convolution and are still ignored, as are referenced SVG filters
- transforming each color before compositing matches compositing first only while the filtered content is opaque; overlapping translucent content differs

### Link to anchors inside the document

`<a href="#section">` now resolves to the element with that `id` and lands on the page holding it, so a table of contents works inside the PDF. A fragment matching no element is dropped rather than written as a link that goes nowhere.

`Node::id` is public, alongside the existing `href`, `alt` and `tag_name` accessors.

### Place background layers

`background-size`, `background-position` and `background-repeat` now apply to gradient layers, which used to stretch across the whole box whatever those properties said.

- `repeat`, `space` and `round` become one PDF tiling pattern per layer, so a repeated gradient costs one shading rather than one per tile
- the positioning area is still the border box; `background-origin` is not read yet

### Bound repeating radial gradients

A repeating radial gradient whose stops all sit at one position expanded to millions of stops, since the period it tiles by collapsed to zero. The expansion now tiles at most 512 periods, stretching the period to keep covering the full radius.

### Pack the structure tree into an object stream

A tagged document wrote one small uncompressed dictionary per structure element, a third of a text-heavy file. They now share a single compressed object stream. A two-page invoice drops 31%, and the whole fixture suite 15%. Tagging, PDF/A and PDF/UA output are unchanged; veraPDF still passes every level.

## takumi-pdf@0.3.0

### Measure a tree without rendering

`measure` returns a tree's laid-out size in CSS px. With page options it lays out at the full-page width with counter hooks filled, exactly how `render` measures a header or footer band. The height tells you how much margin the band needs.

### File attachments

Attach files with `attachments`, the PDF/A-3 shape ZUGFeRD and Factur-X e-invoices use. `data` takes bytes or a UTF-8 string. `modificationDate` falls back to `metadata.creationDate`. Invalid `pdfa` combinations are TypeScript type errors. Without type checking they reject the render at runtime.

### Embed SVG image sources as vectors

SVG images previously rasterized at 2× their placed size, leaving small logos soft next to vector text. They now embed as real paths, gradients and clips, sharp at any zoom. Filters and bitmaps embedded inside an SVG still rasterize at 2×.

### PDF/A and tagged output

Output is now tagged by default, like Chromium's print-to-PDF. The structure tree comes from the HTML semantics: headings, paragraphs, figures with alt text, links, and header/footer artifacts. Decorative `<img alt="">` images are artifacts. `tagged: false` turns the tree off. `tagged: "ua1"` validates against PDF/UA-1.

Set `pdfa` to a level from `"2b"` to `"4"` to emit archival PDFs with an sRGB output intent and XMP metadata. The `a` levels require the structure tree and `metadata.creationDate`. A document that cannot conform rejects the render instead of writing a broken file.

## takumi-pdf@0.2.1

### Shrink the WebAssembly binary by 5%

Size-optimize the PDF serialization and font subsetting crates. The shipped wasm drops about 220KB with render speed and output bytes unchanged.

## takumi-pdf@0.2.0

### Draw header and footer bands in the page margins

Bands previously reserved their height inside the content window, so a footered document paginated earlier than Chrome's print output. They now lay out at full page width and draw in the margin areas with Chromium's 15pt edge inset. The content window always spans the full margin box.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.5

### Write page geometry in PDF points

Pages were sized in CSS px written as pt, so an A4 document came out 33% oversized when printed. Page size, annotations, and outline destinations now convert at 0.75 pt/px. Layout still runs in px.

### Fill the page content box like a browser body

A fit-content root resolved child percentage widths inconsistently across layout passes. Long documents could overlap trailing content and drop pages entirely.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.1

### Auto-height viewport

`viewport.height` is now optional. Omitting it sizes the single page to the laid-out content, like a thermal receipt.

### Render SVG image sources

SVG images passed via `images` came out as blank space; the backend only embedded bitmap sources. SVG sources now rasterize at twice their displayed size and embed like other images.

### Ship the `tw` prop type

Importing only `takumi-pdf` left JSX `tw` props failing to typecheck; the react module augmentation now ships with the package types.

## takumi-pdf@0.1.0

### Publish takumi-pdf, the wasm PDF package

`render(jsx)` turns a node tree or JSX into a paged PDF with selectable text and embedded subset fonts, on Node, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. Options mirror Puppeteer's `page.pdf()`: `size` (`"a4"`, `"letter"`, `{ width, height }`), `landscape`, per-side margins, and repeating header/footer bands with Chromium-style `pageNumber`/`totalPages` class hooks and CSS counter styles, while `viewport` renders a fixed single page instead. Fonts, images, and stylesheets round out the options.
