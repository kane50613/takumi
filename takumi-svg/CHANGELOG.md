### Fix `path()` ignoring device-pixel-ratio

`offset-path: path()` and `clip-path: path()` used the authored SVG coordinates verbatim while every other basic shape crossed the dpr boundary through `to_px`. At `devicePixelRatio != 1` the path was mis-scaled by `1/dpr`. The coordinates are now scaled into device space like the other shapes.

### Render text language-aware with the `lang` attribute

The `lang` attribute sets a node's language and inherits to its descendants; a
nested `lang` overrides, and an empty or invalid value clears it. The language
reaches the shaper as the locale, so the same code point draws its
language-specific glyph (Han unification across `ja` / `zh` / `ko`) and lines
break per language. Pass `lang` in the render options to set a default for the
whole tree.

### Match browser fake-bold for synthesized weights

Synthesize bold only at the CSS bold threshold (weight >= 600), so a medium weight keeps its regular face instead of being faux-bolded. Scale the synthetic stroke with text size — `1/24` easing to `1/32` per Skia — instead of a constant fraction, so large text is no longer over-emboldened.

### Stop resolving `currentColor` in SVG images against the host color
