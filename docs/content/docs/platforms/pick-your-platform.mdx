## Directly in Rust

For native Rust applications, integrating Takumi directly provides the highest level of performance and fine-grained control, ideal when maximum efficiency and direct access to Takumi's core capabilities are required within a Rust environment.

Refer to the [takumi crate on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/takumi/latest/takumi/) for complete documentation and advanced usage.
