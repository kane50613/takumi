## Image Source Compatibility Matrix

The `src` property can be a URL, file path, or a data URI.

To minimize binary size for embedded Takumi versions, certain [features of Takumi](https://docs.rs/crate/takumi/latest/features) are disabled. Alternative solutions may be considered.

| -                | URL | File Path         | Data URI |
|------------------|-----|------------------|----------|
| `@takumi-rs/core`| ❌  | ❌ (use readFile) | ✅       |
| `@takumi-rs/wasm`| ❌  | ❌               | ✅       |
| `takumi-server`  | ✅  | ❌               | ✅       |

## How Image Loading Works in `takumi-server`

When using `takumi-server`, the `src` property of an image node can be:
- A **data URI** (e.g. `data:image/png;base64,...`)
- A **file path** (relative or absolute path on the server)
- A **URL** (e.g. `https://...`)

Image loading and caching in `takumi-server` is handled by two main components:

- **Persistent Cache** (`PersistentImageStore`):
  - Used for images that are preloaded or explicitly inserted into the cache (e.g. via API or initialization).
  - Fast, in-memory, and does not support fetching from remote sources.
  - If an image is found in the persistent cache, it is used immediately.

- **Remote Cache** (`HttpImageStore`):
  - Used for images loaded from URLs (e.g. HTTP/HTTPS links).
  - Maintains an LRU cache of recently fetched images.

### Image Loading Order

When rendering an image node, Takumi resolves the `src` in the following order:
1. **Data URI**: If the `src` is a data URI, it is decoded and loaded directly (requires the `image_data_uri` feature).
2. **Persistent Cache**: If the image is present in the persistent cache, it is used.
3. **Remote Cache**: If the image is not in the persistent cache and the `src` is a URL, the remote cache is checked. If not present, it is fetched and cached (requires the `http_image_store` feature).
