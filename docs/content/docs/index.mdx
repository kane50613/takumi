# Overview

Welcome to the documentation for Takumi!

Takumi is a library for generating images from code using a CSS Flexbox-like layout engine. It allows you to design and create complex images programmatically with a familiar styling model.

_Takumi (åŒ ) means "artisan" or "craftsman" in Japanese - reflecting the precision and artistry required to craft beautiful images through code._

At its core, Takumi works by constructing a tree of nodes, similar to the HTML DOM. You then style them with properties inspired by CSS, and then render the entire tree into a final image.

## Cross-Platform by Design

Takumi is built with Rust and designed for portability. You can use it:

-   **Directly in Rust** for native applications.
-   **In Node.js** via the `@takumi-rs/core` package (N-API).
-   **In the browser** via the `@takumi-rs/wasm` package (WebAssembly).
