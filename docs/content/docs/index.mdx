Welcome to the documentation for Takumi!

Takumi is a library for generating images from code using a CSS Flexbox-like layout engine. It allows you to design and create complex images programmatically with a familiar styling model.

_Takumi (åŒ ) means "artisan" or "craftsman" in Japanese - reflecting the precision and artistry required to craft beautiful images through code._

At its core, Takumi works by constructing a tree of nodes, similar to the HTML DOM. You then style them with properties inspired by CSS, and then render the entire tree into a final image.
