## takumi-core@0.1.0-beta.6

### Support `text-underline-offset`

Add the `text-underline-offset` property, accepting `auto` or a `<length-percentage>` that shifts the underline away from the text. Percentages resolve against `1em`. Applies to the raster and SVG backends.

### Support `font-variant` properties

Add `font-variant` and its `font-variant-ligatures`, `font-variant-numeric`, `font-variant-east-asian`, `font-variant-caps`, and `font-variant-position` longhands. Each maps to OpenType features and resolves before `font-feature-settings`, which still wins on a tag conflict. `font-variant-alternates` and `font-variant-emoji` are out of scope, and missing features are not synthesized.

### Support `background-origin`

Add the `background-origin` property (`border-box`, `padding-box`, `content-box`), which sets the area that `background-position` and `background-size` resolve against. The `background` shorthand reads `<box>` values: the first sets origin and clip, a second overrides clip.

The initial value is `padding-box`, matching CSS, so backgrounds on bordered boxes now position against the padding box instead of the border box.

## takumi-core@0.1.0-beta.3

### Render text language-aware with the `lang` attribute

The `lang` attribute sets a node's language and inherits to its descendants; a
nested `lang` overrides, and an empty or invalid value clears it. The language
reaches the shaper as the locale, so the same code point draws its
language-specific glyph (Han unification across `ja` / `zh` / `ko`) and lines
break per language. Pass `lang` in the render options to set a default for the
whole tree.

## takumi-core@0.1.0-beta.2

### Expand subset font-family without borrowing the font context

A render holds the font context borrowed while it builds text layout, so per-element
`font-family` skipped subset-group expansion and routing relied on the fallback bucket, which
followed `fontique`'s hash iteration order. Content registered with `subset_of` (Rust) or
`subsetOf` (JS) could route to the wrong subset, and the result changed between renders.
Expansion now reads the subset groups without that borrow, and the fallback bucket follows
registration order.

## takumi-core@0.1.0-beta.1

### Match browser fake-bold for synthesized weights

Synthesize bold only at the CSS bold threshold (weight >= 600), so a medium weight keeps its regular face instead of being faux-bolded. Scale the synthetic stroke with text size — `1/24` easing to `1/32` per Skia — instead of a constant fraction, so large text is no longer over-emboldened.

### Keep font metadata when registering loaded fonts

`registerFont` passed only the resolved bytes to the engine, dropping each descriptor's
`name`/`subsetOf`/`weight`/`style`. Subsets that should register under unique names collapsed
onto their intrinsic family, so coverage variants were lost — text rendered as tofu, and which
variant survived depended on fetch-completion order, so the same content rendered differently
each run. Forward the descriptor so the override reaches the engine.

### Key the glyph cache by blob id instead of pointer

A freed font blob's address gets reused by a later font, aliasing its cached glyphs. Use the
blob's stable, never-reused id.

### Load only the Google Font subsets the content needs

`googleFontSubsets(content, families)` scans the codepoints a render uses, fetches every family's metadata in one css2 request, and keeps just the matching `unicode-range` subsets, so a multilingual image pulls a handful of CJK blocks instead of a whole font. Pass a `cache` Map to reuse the CSS across renders.

### Group coverage subsets under one logical family

`FontResource::subset_of` (Rust) and the `subsetOf` font field (JS) register a font as a subset of a logical family. A render expands `font-family: {logical}` into every subset registered under it, in order, so each script routes to the subset that covers it — distinct families no longer share a single fallback chain.

## takumi-core@0.1.0-beta.0

### Split `takumi` into `takumi-core`, `takumi-raster`, and `takumi-svg` behind a re-export facade

### Minimize the public API

`takumi::prelude` exposes the stable data structures, entry-point functions sit at the crate root, the full backend crates move behind an `unstable` feature, and backend internals drop to `pub(crate)`.

### Rename the `raster` feature to `raster-backend`

This mirrors `svg-backend`, and `rayon` no longer enables it implicitly.
