_Takumi (åŒ ) means "artisan" or "craftsman" in Japanese._

A library for generating images using CSS Flexbox layout. Available for Rust, Node.js, and WebAssembly.

It works by rendering a tree of nodes, like a simplified browser engine that outputs images instead of rendering to a screen.

To get started, check out the [Overview](https://takumi.kane.tw/docs/) and the [Pick Your Platform](https://takumi.kane.tw/docs/platforms/pick-your-platform) guide.
