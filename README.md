# Takumi

> ðŸš§ This project is under development.

Library for generating images using a CSS Flexbox-like layout engine. Supports Rust, Node.js (N-API), and WebAssembly runtimes.

_Takumi (åŒ ) means "artisan" or "craftsman" in Japanese - reflecting the precision and artistry required to craft beautiful images through code._

Checkout [documentation](https://takumi.kane.tw) for overview and quick start.

## Overview

Takumi generates images by constructing a tree of nodes, similar to the HTML DOM. You can think of it as a simplified browser engine that outputs an image instead of rendering to a screen.

The core concepts are:

### Nodes

The building blocks of your image. The primary nodes are `ContainerNode` for layout and grouping, `TextNode` for rendering text, `ImageNode` for rendering image.

### Styling

Each node has a `style` property that controls its appearance and layout, using a model inspired by CSS Flexbox.

### Context

A `GlobalContext` holds shared resources like fonts that are used during rendering.

### Rendering

The `ImageRenderer` takes your node tree, calculates the layout, and draws it to an image buffer.

## Packages
