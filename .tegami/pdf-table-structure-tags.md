### Tag tables with PDF structure elements

Tagged output maps `<table>` markup to `Table`, `THead`, `TBody`, `TFoot`,
`TR`, `TH` and `TD` structure elements, with `Caption` for `<caption>`,
`Scope` on header cells, and `RowSpan`/`ColSpan` on spanning cells. A table
that spans pages stays one `Table` element. Screen readers navigate the
table by row and column.
