### Merge `takumi-css` into `takumi-core`

Fold the CSS parsing, cascade, value types, selector matching, and `@keyframes`
layer back into `takumi-core` and drop the separate `takumi-css` crate. The
`style` module is reachable through `layout::style` as before; `matching` is now
crate-private. Core builds at `opt-level = "z"`, shrinking the napi `.node` ~7%
and the wasm binary ~8% with no render-path regression.
