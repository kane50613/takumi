### Apply the color `filter` primitives

`grayscale`, `sepia`, `saturate`, `hue-rotate`, `invert`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `opacity` now apply. They are linear transforms of the source color, so they fold into the colors written to the page, including gradient stops, text and decoded image pixels, instead of rasterizing the element.

- filters compose down the stacking contexts, so a filtered ancestor reaches its descendants
- `blur()` and `drop-shadow()` need a convolution and are still ignored, as are referenced SVG filters
- transforming each color before compositing matches compositing first only while the filtered content is opaque; overlapping translucent content differs
