### Clip elements with `clip-path`

`inset()`, `ellipse()`, `polygon()` and `path()` now clip an element and its decorations, as a real PDF clipping path rather than a rasterized mask.

`clip_shape_commands` in takumi-core resolves a basic shape to path commands, which is where the raster backend's copy of that geometry now lives too.
