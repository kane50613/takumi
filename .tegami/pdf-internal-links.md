### Link to anchors inside the document

`<a href="#section">` now resolves to the element with that `id` and lands on the page holding it, so a table of contents works inside the PDF. A fragment matching no element is dropped rather than written as a link that goes nowhere.

`Node::id` is public, alongside the existing `href`, `alt` and `tag_name` accessors.
