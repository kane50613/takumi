### Pack the structure tree into an object stream

A tagged document wrote one small uncompressed dictionary per structure element, a third of a text-heavy file. They now share a single compressed object stream. A two-page invoice drops 31%, and the whole fixture suite 15%. Tagging, PDF/A and PDF/UA output are unchanged; veraPDF still passes every level.
